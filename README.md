*Last Updated: 28.05.2025*  

This document outlines the **Privacy Policy** and **Terms of Service** (ToS) governing the use of **byfox's Discord bots**, including **StormaBOT** (ID: 1094639423708217396). By adding or using any of these bots, you agree to comply with these terms. This policy supplements, but does not override, Discord’s [Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal).  

## **1. Definitions**  
- **Bot(s)**: Refers to any Discord bot(s) operated by byfox (e.g., StormaBOT).  
- **Server Manager**: Any user with permissions to add, configure, or manage the bot in a Discord server (e.g., admins/moderators).  
- **Server Member**: Any user participating in a server where the bot is active.  
- **Guild/Server ID**: The unique identifier for a Discord server.  
- **User Data**: Information collected automatically or provided by users.

## **2. Data Collection & Usage**  

### **A. Data Collected by Command**  
When users interact with specific bot commands (e.g., `/settings`), the following data may be stored:  
- **Guild ID** (to identify the server).  
- **Channel ID** (for bot functionality).  

### **B. Automatically Collected Data**  
For operational purposes, the bot may collect:  
- **Guild IDs** (to maintain bot services).  
- **Temporary cached data** (e.g., permissions, roles – deleted upon bot restart).  

### **C. What We Do NOT Collect**  
- Personal messages (DMs) outside of bot commands.  
- Sensitive user data (e.g., passwords, payment info).  
- Unrelated server content (e.g., non-bot-related chats).  

---  

## **3. Data Storage & Security**  
- **Retention**: Guild/Channel IDs are stored only as long as necessary for bot functionality.  
- **Deletion**: All data is **automatically deleted** when the bot is removed from a server. No manual action is required.  
- **Security**: We implement industry-standard measures to protect data but cannot guarantee absolute security.

## **4. Feedback & Contributions**  
By submitting feedback (bugs, suggestions, etc.), you:  
- Grant us unrestricted rights to use, modify, or implement it.  
- Waive ownership claims to the feedback provided.

## **5. Limitation of Liability**  
- The bot is provided **"as is"** – we are not liable for service interruptions or misuse.  
- We do not endorse or monitor server content where the bot is active.  

---  

## **6. Changes to This Policy**  
We reserve the right to update this policy. Continued bot use constitutes acceptance of changes.
